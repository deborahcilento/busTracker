# busTracker
Program with one button that shows bus stops between MIT and Harvard using MapBox's API. I made some styling changes to make it look prettier including changes in the map itself and the button.

Roadmap For Future Improvements: 
I am going to change the map's location to my hometown of Granger, Indiana. I am also going to change the map marker.
